<title>Overview of the Triggerware Java Client</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The Triggerware Java Client Library provides classes for implementing Java clients of a 
Triggerware Server &lt;link to triggerware server documentation goes here&gt;.  Throughout this api documentation, 
as well as in some class and method names, the abbreviated text <b>TW</b> is used in place of the longer name <b>Triggerware</b>.
</p><p> You are viewing the detailed JavaDoc documentation of this library. Documentation on use of the library, and examples
of its use, can be found in &lt;link to Java TW Client Library usage documentation goes here&gt;
</p><p>This library is loosely modeled on 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.sql/module-summary.html">the Java JDBC api </a>
It consists of a single package {@link calqlogic.twservercomms} This package contains several classes and methods with names 
and functionality
analogous to those found in JDBC's <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.sql/javax/sql/package-summary.html">java.sql</a> package.

</p><p>In particular, the library contains classes that enable a client to</p>
<ul>
<li> create and close connections to a TW server </li>
<li> make requests for services provided by a TW server and obtain the results of those requests </li>
<li> handle notifications sent to the client by a TW server </li>
</ul>

<p> A Triggerware Server is not an sql database, though it does provide access to data using a tabular data model. The differences
between Triggerware and a true sql server are too significant, however, 
for the real JDBC API to be hooked up to a Triggerware Server via a custom driver,in the manner that JDBC is adapted to true 
sql servers. 
The version 1.0 Triggerware client has far more limited 
 {@link calqlogic.twservercomms.QueryStatement Statement} objects than actual JDBC. These statements provide quite general
 capabilities for <em>querying</em> the tabular data. However these statements cannot
</p>
<ul>
<li> update the tabular data</li>
<li> define new tables </li>
<li> define or invoke new server-side procedures </li>
<li> define new server-side functions for use in queries.</li>
</ul>
<p>These capabilities must be supplied by a comination of specific requests from the client to the server together with
 client-independent configuration of the Triggerware Server &lt;link to triggerware server documentation goes here&gt;.
</p>
<!--  <p>Like some relational database servers, a TW server allows a client to register for notification of  certain
<em>changes</em> to the data known to the server.  A java client performs this registration through {@link calqlogic.twservercomms.Subscription Subscriptions}.
</p> -->
<p>A Triggerware application will involve application-specific configuration of the TW server
&lt;link to triggerware server documentation goes here&gt; Such configuration will involve informing the server of sources
of tablular data of interest to the application and possibly adding new procedures to the server that can be invoked by clients.
</p><p>
Java  TW application clients that use this library will define a subclass of the class
{@link calqlogic.twservercomms.TriggerwareClient TriggerwareClient}.  The subclass will provide some combination of </p>
<ul>
<li> application specific uses of the classes and methods in this library, </li>
<li>  application specific logic to manipulate the data obtained from the TW server in responses to requests
 and in notifiations.
</ul>
<p>
In particular, a TW application Java client will use the methods of this library that make requests to the TW server containing
 queries and triggering conditions for notifications.  The queries and triggering conditions
 are expressed as strings in either of two supported notations</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL -- this notation uses the syntax of SQL queries with table names that refer to the tabular data known to the 
configured TW server.
 A slight extension to SQL syntax is provided to describe triggering conditions.  More detail on the SQL available to TW clients
 can be found in &lt;link to TW SQL documentation goes here&gt;</li>
<li>FOL -- this notation is based on the concepts of first order logic, using a syntax from the programming language Lisp.
Details can be found in <a href="https://ap5.com/doc/ap5-man.html">the AP5 reference manual</a></li>
</ul>
