/**
 * <p>A Subscription represents, via a two-state condition (see TW server documenation), some change to the data managed by the
 *  TW server about which a client would like to be notified.  The two-state condition determines the form of notification as 
 *  a row of values, just like a row in a resultset returned from a one-state query. The subscription's generic parameter
 *  specifies the java class into which the row of values in a notification should be deserialized and made available to the
 *  subscribing client.
 *  The subscription's   {@link #handleNotification} method provides the means
 *  for the client to handle notifications of the triggering of the condition detected by the TW server.
 * </p><p>,<em>Creating</em> a subscription does not necessitate any interaction with the TW server, and does not detect any
 * errors that might exist in the text that defines the tw-state condition. The {@link #activate} method activates that
 * subscription on the server so that notifications of changes that meet the condition are sent to the client.  
 * </p><p>A subscription may be activated on any of the client's connections at any time, but may be active on only 
 * one connection at any time.  Notifications resulting
 * from an active Subscription arrive on the connection on which that Subscription was activated.  Activating a subscription
 * will only cause notifications to be sent about changes that occur <em>after</em> the activation is accepted by the TW server,
 * so there <em>could</em> be a race between sending an activate request and changes to data that are not synchronized with respect to
 * that activation.
 * </p><p> When a notification from  an active subscription arrives at the TriggerwarClient, it is dispatched to the subscription's
 * {link #handleNotification} method. Execution of the handleNotification methods for subscriptions -- whether the same 
 * or different subscriptions -- are serialized with respect to one another and with respect to notifications 
 * for active PolledQueries.  This means that, on any
 * given connection, the notifications are handled sequentially, in arrival order.  A <em>handleNotification</em> method is of
 * course free to use another thread to perform time consuming actions, freeing the connection's notification handling thread
 * to handle later arriving notifications.
 * </p><p>The {@link #deactivate} method deactivates the Subscription. Deactivating a subscription
 * has no effect on notifications previously sent by the server but not yet processed by the client. As with activation, there
 * can be a race between sending the deactivate request and changes to data that are not synchronized with respect to making that
 * request.  The client is assured that no additional notifications will be transmitted by the server <em>after</em>the server has
 * processed the deactivate request.
 * </p><p>The TW server is incapable of detecting, and thus notifying about, changes satisfying some  two-state conditions.
 * The only way of determining whether notifications of changes  are supported for a particular condition is to activate
 * a subscription using that condition. The activate request throws an exception  for unsupported conditions.
 * </p>

 * <h2> Individual vs. Batch Notification </h2>
 * <p>In the TW server, changes to data can occur as part of transactions (see TW server documentation). The states of the data
 * prior to and following a transaction are the states referenced by the two-state condition of a Subscription.  It is possible
 * (in many applications it will be common) that the condition of a Subscription will be satisfied for multiple rows of data
 * across a single transaction, and/or that the conditions of <em>multiple</em> Subscriptions will be satisfied across a single
 * transaction.  Flexibility in dealing with this possibility is provided by distinguishing between individual subscriptions and
 * batch subscriptions.
 * </p><p> Subscriptions activated (via {@link #activate activate}) for individual notification will result in a 
 * sequence of notifications being sent
 * to the client in these cases, and those notifications will be handled as just described above.  
 * The order in which these arrive is arbitrary, and multiple notifications for a single subscription
 * may be interleaved with those of another.  For many notifications, the fact that multiple interesting changes occurred in a 
 * single transaction is not significant, and handling them sequentially is acceptable.
 * </p><p> 
 * An alternative is to group one or more Subscriptions in a {@link BatchSubscription}. When activated for batch notification,
 * all the notifications for all the Subscriptions in that BatchSubscription resulting from a single transaction
 *  are delivered in a single notification and can be processed by a single handler.
 * @param <T> <p>The Java class that will be used to represent a single row of values that triggers the subscription's condition.
 * Each row arriving in a notification from the subscription will <em>deserialize</em> into a freshly allocated instance of this class.
 * This class cannot be a primitive java type.  Often it will be a Java 'bean' with suitable annotations for deserialization.
 * A row is <em>serialized</em> by the TW server as a json array whose elements are determined by the subscription's triggering condition.
 * </p><p>
 * The class may be Object[], or some generic Collection class with Object as the type parameter (e.g., ArrayList&lt;Object&gt;), in
 * which case a row will be deserialized as an Array or Collection whose elements are the default deserialization for whatever
 * Json text appears in the row's serial representation.
 *</p><p>
 In most uses of Subscriptions, the triggering condition is known at code-authoring time, 
 and thus so is the 'type signature' of the triggering condition, which determines the serialization. It is almost always
 possible to provide a more specific row type for a Subscription than simply Object[] -- usually one that is far more useful
 in coding the handling of the notification than simply an array or collection of Objects.
 * </p>
