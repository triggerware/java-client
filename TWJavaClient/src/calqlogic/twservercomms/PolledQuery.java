/**
 * <p>
 * A PolledQuery is a query that will be executed by the TW server multiple times. The first time it is executed
 * the result (a set of 'rows') establishes a 'current state' of the query. For each succeeding execution (referred to
 * as <em>polling</em> the query), </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li> the new result is compared with the current state, and the differences are sent to the triggerware client
 * in a notification containing a {@link RowsDelta} value.
 * <li> the new answer  becomes the current state to be used for comparison with the result of the next poll of the query.
 * </ul>
 * <p> Like any other query, a PolledQuery has a query string, a language (FOL or SQL), and a namespace.
 *</p><p> A polling operation may be performed at any time by executing the {@link #poll()} method.
 *Some details of reporting and polling can be configured with a {@link PolledQuery.PolledQueryControlParameters}
 *value that is supplied to the constructor of a PolledQuery.
 *</p><p>
 *After creating an instance of PolledQuery, it must be 'registered' with its Triggerware server by executing the register method.
 *</p><p>
 *PolledQuery is an abstract class. An instantiable subclass of PolledQuery must provide or inherit a {@link #handleSuccess} method to deal with notifications of 
 *changes to the current state.  There are errors that can occur during a polling operation (timeout, inability to contact
 *a data source).  When such an error occurs, the TW Server will send an "error" notification.
 *An instantiable subclass of PolledQuery may provide a {@link #handleError} method to deal with error notifications.
 *</p><p>
 *{@link ScheduledQuery} is a subclass of PolledQuery which provides for polling to occur based on a schedule, rather than 
 *solely on demand (ie, solely by virtue of the client submitting a poll request to the TW server). The existence of 
 *scheduled queries is the reason that state deltas are sent to the client as notifications, even when a poll is explicitly
 *requested. Scheduled queries may still be polled on demand at any time.
 *</p><p>
 *Polling is terminated when the {@link #close} method is performed.
 *</p><p>
 * If a polling operation is ready to start (whether due to its schedule or an explicit poll request) and a previous poll of
 * the query has not completed, the poll operation that is ready to start is simply skipped, and an error notification is
 * sent to the client.
 *</p>
 * @param <T> the class that repesents a single 'row' of the answer to the query.
 * @see ScheduledQuery
